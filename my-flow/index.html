        <p style="color:rgba(241, 133, 133, 0.582); text-align:center">I really enjoy playing piano and I often lose track of time while playing.</p>
        <p class="pink;" style="text-align:center;">I've been playing since I was 4 years old, making it 11 years since I've began.<br> When I was young, I used to beg my parents to let me play, and I started as soon as they let me. <br>Playing helps me to de-stress and distract myself from anxiety!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">I firmly believe that everyone should find an activity that makes them happy and distracted; for me, this is piano!<br><a href="https://www.europianosnaples.com/piano-keys-101/" target="_blank" style="color:rgba(150, 189, 189, 0.884);">Learn the piano basics here!</a>            </p>
