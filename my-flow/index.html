    <title>Sienna's Flow</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>What is my flow?</h1>
    <p>I really enjoy playing piano, I often lose track of time while playing.<br> I've been playing since I was 4 years old, making it 11 years since I've began.<br> When I was young, I used to beg my parents to let me play, and I started as soon as they
        let me. <br>Playing helps me to de-stress and distract myself from anxiety!</p>
    <p>I firmly believe that everyone should find an activity that makes them happy and distracted; for me, this is piano!<br> <a href="https://www.europianosnaples.com/piano-keys-101/" target="_blank">Learn the piano basics here!</a> </p>
