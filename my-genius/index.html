        <h1 class="header">Rowing</h1>
        <h2 class="header">My genius is crew, I've been rowing for four years!</h2>
        <h3 class="header">Here are the basics for learning to row:</h3>
        <h3 class="header">Vocabulary:</h3>
        <p class="text-center">Here is some vocabulary that is helpful to know, remembering that rowers sit with their back towards the front of the boat.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Port: left of the boat, right from a rower's perspective.</li>
            <li>Starboard: right of the boat, left from a rower's perspective.</li>
            <li>Bow: front of the boat, back from a rower's perspective. </li>
            <li>Stern: back of the boat, front from a rower's perspective. </li>
            <li>Scull: rowing with two oars (doubles, quads are most common examples of sculling boats).</li>
            <li>Sweep: rowing with one long oar (2x, 4x, 8x are most common examples of sweeping boats).</li>
            <li>Bow pair: the first two people to cross the finish line.</li>
            <li>Stroke/Stern pair: the last two people to cross the finish line. </li>
            <li>Bow Seat: in boats without coxswains, the bow seat (seat 1) is responsible for navigating the water and calling directions. </li>
            <li>Stroke Seat: the stroke seat (seat 2-8 depending on shell) is responsible for setting the stroke rate and ratio.</li>
            <li>Coxswain: the coxswain is responsible for navigating the water, calling out directions, and motivating the crew. They are often short and face towards the bow end of the boat.</li>
            <li>Rigger: the part of the boat that extends outward and holds the oars.</li>
            <li>Oarlock: holds the oars in place.</li>
            <li>Footstretchers: the shoes in the boat where you put your feet. You should adjust them depending on the length of your legs - aka a rower's nightmare.</li>
            <li>Spacers: ajusts the height of the oars.</li>
            <li>"Weigh Enough:" rowing word for "stop what you're doing."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are many more vocabulary words/language that rowers should know, however, they are not necessarily important for a basic understanding of the sport. </p>

        <h3 class="header">How to take a stroke:</h3>
        <p>"The catch" is the beginning of the stroke, where your blades are squared and burried in the water. Your knees should be bent with your arms reaching out towards the stern, making sure to keep your posture in check. Next, quickly straighten your
            legs during "the drive." Pull your arms in towards your body, lean back to extend your stroke, and feather your blades during "the release." "The recovery" is an intergral part of the stroke where you allow for the boat to run under you; having
            a short recovery makes for a hard row and the boat go slower. Quickly push your arms away from your body and slowly bend your legs to return to "the catch." Make sure to match the person in front of you throughout the stroke, it keeps the
            boat travelling fast and looks neat. It helps to look at their back instead of their oars. However, if you are the stroke seat, make sure to keep a consistant ratio. If you are bow seat, look behind you every 3ish strokes and yell commands
            <em>loudly!</em></p>
