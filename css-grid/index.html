            <h3>How to take a stroke:</h3>
            <p>"The catch" is the beginning of the stroke, where your blades are squared and burried in the water. Your knees should be bent with your arms reaching out towards the stern, making sure to keep your posture in check. Next, quickly straighten
                your legs during "the drive," be sure to make it quick to avoid splashing the person behind you. Pull your arms in towards your body, lean back to extend your stroke, and feather your blades during "the release." "The recovery" is an intergral
                part of the stroke where you allow for the boat to run under you; having a short recovery makes for a hard row and the boat go slower. Quickly push your arms away from your body and slowly bend your legs to return to "the catch." Make
                sure to match the person in front of you throughout the stroke, it keeps the boat travelling fast and looks neat. It helps to look at their back instead of their oars. However, if you are the stroke seat, make sure to keep a consistant
                ratio. If you are bow seat, look behind you every 3ish strokes and yell commands
                <em>loudly!</em></p>

            <p>There is a common saying among rowers: there are two types, those who have flipped, and those who haven't ... <em>yet.</em></p>
            <p>I have flipped numerous times, especially in singles; it's nothing to be embarrassed about! Typically, capsizes will occur in smaller boats, though it is definently possible in larger boats also. Boats are more suceptible to flip in windy
                weather, which is why it's best to have a land practice when the winds are above 15mph.</p>
