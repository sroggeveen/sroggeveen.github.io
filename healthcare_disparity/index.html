            <h3>What are healthcare disparities?</h3>
            <p>Healthcare disparities are the differences and gaps in the quality of healthcare one recieves based on their race, gender, or class. There are multiple definitions of a "healthcare disparity," but is often known as a preventable difference
                in the quality of healthcare and the ability to achieve optimal health that adversely and disproportionately affects marginalized groups of people, or those who have been systematically oppressed. Often, healthcare disparities result from
                systematic racism in the medical field, overt racism, educational differences, access to healthcare, environmental conditions, poverty, language barriers, and more. Unfairly advantages some people over others, and puts some at risk for
                preventable health conditions.</p>
