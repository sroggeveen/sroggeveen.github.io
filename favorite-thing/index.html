    <h1>What is my favorite part about school?</h1>
    <h2>My favorite part of school is hanging out with friends!</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy spending time with my <em>friends!</em> </p>
    <p>I love eating lunch together, hanging out together in the mornings, and even doing homework together.</p>
    <p>In the mornings, my friend and I arrive at school at 7am (and have been since <em>5th grade</em>) for our 0 period class.</p>
    <p>During free periods, classes, and flex time we also chat and hang out.</p>
    <p>Everyday, we also always eat lunch together and catch up about our days.</p>
    <p>Some of my close friends are also on the rowing team with me, so we spend time together there also!</p>
